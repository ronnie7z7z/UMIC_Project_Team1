#pseudo code 
for obstacle detected:
   if obstacle has round surface or has visible convex corner:
      avoid
      continue
    if obstacle has visible concave corner:
      follow
    elif obstacle has edge:
      start following
      if first turn:
         if linear and angular in different sense: #ex:linear left angular clockwise
            avoid, this is a convex corner of an obstacle
            continue
         else:
            follow, this is a wall


# the 'follow' function
align cmd_vel (wrt map) along wall, angular velocity compulsorily zero except while turning
publish information about first turn
for every few metres:
   capture pictures on the wall if any
   if exit is found:
      if no. pictures captured<5:
          add to map, continue
      else:
          receive validation from image processing team if photos have been correctly captured
          if validated:
             proceed to exit to go to maze
          else:
             add exit to map
             go to start location and follow again
